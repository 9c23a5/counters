# counters

A basic Rails app for counting things.

## Motivation

I wanted a project that is simple on the database/ActiveRecord side so I can focus primarirly on learning frontend stuff.

## Features

- Count gets synchronized between pages using Turbo Streams

## Todo

- Properly SPA the app
- Preview the count on index and use Turbo Streams on it aswell
- Learn ViewComponents and apply what I can here
- Style the webpage: Learn Sass, bonus points if get Tailwind working
